# HR app project

In this project I practise React by creating interactive cards of employees.

## Functionality

Each card represents information about an employee. Depending on his/her duration of work, an icon appears in the upper right corner of each card. You may promote an employee by pressing the "Promote" button. You may demote them too. Furthermore, you may change information by pressing the "Edit" button. There are used such custom hooks as useAxios to fetch the API and useEmployeeStatus to calculate the years' logic.

## Tech used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, APIs
